## Python - Flakes8 Validation
The Flake8 linting tool is used to identify code-quality issues and check the Python code for PEP8 requirements.

In some cases, the Flake8 validation was ignored for a specific line of code. This was done by adding a `# noqa` comment at the end of the line.

The following Flake8 errors were ignored:
- F401: Imported but unused. Added to unsused imports in files that was generated by Django, but not used in the project.
- E501: Line too long. Added to lines that was too long, but not possible to split into multiple lines, or where it would make the code less readable.
- exlude: `migrations` folders. Added to exclude the migrations folders, as they are generated by Django.

## HTML Validation
The HTML markup was validated using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). Since the Django templating language was used, the validation was done on the public rendered HTML pages, that not required a user to be logged in.
